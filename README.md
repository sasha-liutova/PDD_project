# PDD_project

This project focuses on extracting JavaScript snippets from Stack Overflow web platform (http://stackoverflow.com/) and performing clustering and visualisation of this data. First, filtering out unmeaningful snippets
and code in different languages was performed. Then, snippets were vectorized using Bag-of-words and Tf-idf techniques. Clustering was
done using K-Means algorithm. For visualisation, data was processed by truncated SVD and t-SNE sequentially. Obtained results were analysed.
